## Limitation

1. Quota limitation are 10,000 each day and update take 50 unit each, 200 times or less (cuz get listing also cost 10 unit) of upload are all I get
2. Can't do anything with song mark with "Explicit"
3. Youtube music general problem that deleted/moved relatively new song to other location

## List for future implementation

1. Future optimization/problem and feature to implement
   1. able to sort with secondary/thirdly variable
   2. better UX design (user instruction etc.)
   3. user customizable table
   4. consider the fact of quota limitation this app will keep as simple as sorting playlist
2. TanStack react-query / table / virtual
   1. useInfiniteQuery to fetch data
   2. replace useEffect with better hook
3. shadcn
   1. replace mui with shadcn and tailwind css
   2. make a better looking table instead of the default mui table
4. dnd-kit
   1. to give more flexibility to the user to customized their playlist
